[solution1]
pysc2 has switched from python-gflags to absl.flags in deepmind/pysc2@f2f96c0 
Need to find ways to change:
import gflags as flags 
to 
from absl import flags

[solution2]
This repo uses gflags library, where pysc2 uses absl flags library. Inf your program You just have to set:
if name == 'main':
import sys
from absl import flags
FLAGS = flags.FLAGS
FLAGS(sys.argv)
main()
